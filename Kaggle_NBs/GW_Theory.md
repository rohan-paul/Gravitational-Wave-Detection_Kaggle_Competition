Gravitational wave data analysis employs many of the
standard tools of time-series analysis. With some exceptions, the majority of gravitational wave data analysis
is performed in the frequency domain.

Data from gravitational wave detectors are recorded as time series that include contributions
from myriad noise sources in addition to any gravitational wave signals. When regularly sampled
data are available, such as for ground based and future space based interferometers, analyses are
typically performed in the frequency domain, where stationary (time invariant) noise processes can
be modeled very efficiently.
