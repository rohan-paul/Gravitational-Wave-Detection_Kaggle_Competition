### What are Gravitational Waves?

Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in space-time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 in his general theory of relativity. Einstein's mathematics showed that massive accelerating objects (such as neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other) would disrupt space-time in such a way that 'waves' of undulating space-time would propagate in all directions away from the source. These cosmic ripples would travel at the speed of light, carrying with them information about their origins, as well as clues to the nature of gravity itself.

The strongest gravitational waves are produced by cataclysmic events such as colliding black holes, supernovae (massive stars exploding at the end of their lifetimes), and colliding neutron stars. Other waves are predicted to be caused by the rotation of neutron stars that are not perfect spheres, and possibly even the remnants of gravitational radiation created by the Big Bang.

On September 14, 2015 for the very first time, LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) physically sensed the undulations in spacetime caused by gravitational waves generated by two colliding black holes 1.3 billion light-years away. LIGO's discovery will go down in history as one of humanity's greatest scientific achievements.

While the processes that generate gravitational waves can be extremely violent and destructive, by the time the waves reach Earth they are thousands of billions of times smaller! In fact, by the time gravitational waves from LIGO's first detection reached us, the amount of space-time wobbling they generated was a 1000 times smaller than the nucleus of an atom! Such inconceivably small measurements are what LIGO was designed to make.

Gravitational wave data analysis employs many of the
standard tools of time-series analysis. With some exceptions, the majority of gravitational wave data analysis
is performed in the frequency domain.

Data from gravitational wave detectors are recorded as time series that include contributions
from myriad noise sources in addition to any gravitational wave signals. When regularly sampled
data are available, such as for ground based and future space based interferometers, analyses are
typically performed in the frequency domain, where stationary (time invariant) noise processes can
be modeled very efficiently.

As shown by Einstein himself, the Genearal Relativity Theory of Gravitation allows for wave-like solutions which are generated
by accelerated mass motion (or, more generally, by energy momentum tensor as should be for
a relativistic theory).

### Time Domain vs Frequency Domain Analysis ?

A **Time domain analysis** is an analysis of physical signals, mathematical functions, or time series of economic or environmental data, in reference to time. Also, in the time domain, the signal or function's value is understood for all real numbers at various separate instances in the case of discrete-time or the case of continuous-time. Furthermore, an oscilloscope is a tool commonly used to see real-world signals in the time domain.

Moreover, a time-domain graph can show how a signal changes with time.

In **Frequency domain** your model/system is analyzed according to it's response for different frequencies. How much of the signal lie in different frequency range. Theoretically signals are composed of many sinusoidal signals with different frequencies (Fourier series), like triangle signal, its actually composed of infinite sinusoidal signal (fundamental and odd harmonics frequencies).

We can move from time domain to frequency domain with the help of Fourier transform.

### The problem of glitches in LIGO data and how Data Science can help

I quote from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11831.pdf) paper named "Efficient Gravitational-wave Glitch Identification from Environmental Data Through
Machine Learning"

It goes on to say, Modern interferometric gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are highly complex and sensitive instruments. Each detector is sensitive not only to gravitational radiation, but also to noise from sources including the physical environment, seismic activity, and complications in the detector itself. The output data of these
detectors is therefore also highly complex. In addition to
the desired signal, the GW data stream contains sharp
lines in its noise spectrum and non-Gaussian transients,
or “glitches,” that are not astrophysical in origin.
Instrumental artifacts in the GW data stream can be
mistaken for short-duration, unmodeled GW events, and
noisy data can also decrease the confidence in compact
binary detections, sometimes by orders of magnitude
